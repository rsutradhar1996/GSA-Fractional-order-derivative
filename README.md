# GSA-Fractional-order-derivative
First  run the file Run_and_Plot.m. (first section only)  This matlab script calls the m-file parameter.m and Model_FDE.m (written in first section).
After 1000 simulation (will be shown on Command Window), the second section calculates the prcc values at t=800^th day and produces the scatter plots.  
The third section calculates the prcc values at t=800^th day and produces the hexagonal diagrams.
